If Dr. Semmelweis looks troubled it's probably because he's thinking about <em>childbed fever</em>: A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth. He is thinking about it because in the early 1840s at the Vienna General Hospital as many as 10% of the women giving birth die from it. He is thinking about it because he knows the cause of childbed fever: It's the contaminated hands of the doctors delivering the babies. And they won't listen to him and <em>wash their hands</em>!</p>\n<p>In this notebook, we're going to reanalyze the data that made Semmelweis discover the importance of <em>handwashing</em>. Let's start by looking at the data that made Semmelweis realize that something was wrong with the procedures at Vienna General Hospital.</p>","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"13f090f9f0"},"run_control":{"frozen":true},"tags":["context"]},"id":"b4f6a7c2-c2d4-4433-a368-0b47292b877e","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# importing modules\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv into yearly\nyearly = pd.read_csv('datasets/yearly_deaths_by_clinic.csv')\n\n# Print out yearly\nprint(yearly)","metadata":{"dc":{"key":"13f090f9f0"},"tags":["sample_code"],"trusted":true},"id":"c2b46bfa-011a-4a35-883b-89b7d3f09ebb","cell_type":"code","execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"    year  births  deaths    clinic\n0   1841    3036     237  clinic 1\n1   1842    3287     518  clinic 1\n2   1843    3060     274  clinic 1\n3   1844    3157     260  clinic 1\n4   1845    3492     241  clinic 1\n5   1846    4010     459  clinic 1\n6   1841    2442      86  clinic 2\n7   1842    2659     202  clinic 2\n8   1843    2739     164  clinic 2\n9   1844    2956      68  clinic 2\n10  1845    3241      66  clinic 2\n11  1846    3754     105  clinic 2\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"source":"## 2.
